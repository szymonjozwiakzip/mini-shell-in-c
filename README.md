# mini-shell-in-c


Welcome in my own implementation of mini shell in C. It was my first study project in C. I was supposed to do some own implementation of commands but also handle commands that refer by name to programs located in directories described by the value of the PATH environment variable and allow these scripts and programs to be called with arguments (using fork and exec functions). To see all available commands (except commands called using fork and exec) you can type help. Before any typed command you can see your username and path to actual location in your computer. I also implemented tic tac toe game which you can find on my other repository on my github.
